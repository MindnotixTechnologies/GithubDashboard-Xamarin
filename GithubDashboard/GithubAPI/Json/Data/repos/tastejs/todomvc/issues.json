But because it is stateful, template-based, and embraces reactive programming principles, it solves the same problems as MVC frameworks.\r\n\r\nIts focus is on ease of use and performance. It works by parsing templates and maintaining a 'parallel DOM' in JavaScript land, which reacts to state changes and updates the DOM whenever necessary.\r\n\r\nThe app is tested in all modern browsers and meets the specification, as far as I can tell. Let me know if you have any questions about it.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    "body": "There have been a couple of requests for creating a durandal example in here. This [discussion ](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/issues/518) was closed a few months back with a note to reopen when there is a spec-compliant implementation. This is the spec compliant implementation.\r\n\r\nAnother [request for durandal](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/issues/634) was made a few weeks back.\r\n\r\nAs for why include Durandal - EisenbergEffect (also one of the main contributers to durandal) has outlined the framework well in this [comment ](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/issues/518#issuecomment-15951713).\r\n\r\nI see durandal gathering a fair bit of steam in the past few months, and we're close to production with our durandal based financial services site from our organization. \r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the comments, durandal uses a combination of knockout and sammy to provide a high level framework for single page applications.\r\n\r\nMy code borrows heavily from the knockout js example for all the data binding, but to demonstrate the capabilities of durandal illustrates the following concepts\r\n\r\n* Composition - The html is composed from multiple modules - *shell*, *entry* and *list*. The shell contains markup references for *entry* and *list* modules. The *entry* module provides the markup and viewmodel only for entering tasks. The *list* module is responsible for display and managing the list of tasks \r\n\r\n* Communication - The implementation demonstrates durandals eventing system by making the entry module agnostic of the *list* module. the *entry* module simply broadcasts the addition of a new task which is then picked up  by the *list* module.\r\n\r\n* Module Lifecycle - the *list* module has an activation event which is triggered by the durandal framework. On activation, the tasks are retrieved from the local storage and initialized in the observable array.\r\n\r\nI think I've adhered to all the coding guidelines, but the only issue is that since I didn't want to disturb the learn.json file in the root directory, the page does not show the helper on the left hand side. Let me know what i need to do to make that work.\r\n"

    "body": "According to [this page](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/wiki/The-relationship-between-regions-and-layouts), the difference between a `Layout` and an `ItemView` in Marionette is that a layout can contain regions into which other layouts or views can be rendered. In [`TodoMVCLayout.js`](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/blob/gh-pages/labs/architecture-examples/backbone_marionette/js/TodoMVC.Layout.js), two elements are added to the `Layout` module, but one of these (`Header`) is defined as an `ItemView` not a `Layout`. The other, `Footer`, is defined as a `Layout`, but as far as I can tell does not contain any regions. I found this rather confusing. Is there a value in defining the header and footer as `Layout`s, or would it be reasonable to define them as plain `ItemView`s, and define them in the `TodoList.Views` module?"

    "body": "I just started playing with Ember and tried to replicate the todo app using the REST Adapter instead of the LocalStorage one. Overall it went well, however I noticed that the todo model is made in a way that every time the vale of the todo is changed (when editing it) the store commits the change. This is because the models `todoDidChange` function [observes the title attribute](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/blob/gh-pages/architecture-examples/emberjs/js/models/todo.js#L12) which in turn has a two-way binding to the value of the input box.\r\n\r\nThis works fine when using localStorage but when I tried to do the same the RESTful way it meant that the app sent a PUT request to the server every time the value on the text box was changed which caused some yankiness even if you typed moderately slow.\r\n\r\nWhat I did was create a one-way binding instead from the model value to the text box (so it got populated with the the todo title) and updated it when the `insertNewLine` function ran:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// edit_todo_view.js\r\nTodos.EditTodoView = Ember.TextField.extend({\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    valueBinding: Ember.Binding.oneWay('todo.title'),\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    insertNewline: function () {\r\n        this.set('controller.isEditing', false);\r\n        this.set('todo.title', this.get('value'));\r\n    },\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way the model is persisted only when you press enter. This also makes it possible to \"reset\" the todo title back to its previous value on blur, with the current implementation you have to re-type the whole thing again if you want the same functionality.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering if it's something you'd like to incorporate on the Ember example, like I said I'm just starting with ember so there could be room for improvement but I think it's a nice way to also showcase how useful one-way bindings can be."

    "body": "I'd like to propose the [Sails.JS](http://www.sailsjs.org) be added to todoMVC as a Realtime MVC framework.  Sails.JS is a newer Node.JS Framework built on proven code like express and socket.IO.   While still being new, Sails.JS packs quite a punch out of the box.  Sails.JS supports websockets via Socket.IO and has a RESTful JSON api that uses the same codebase out of the box.  Blueprints are another feature that makes Sails.JS one of the fastest frameworks to get started with.  With blueprints, all you need is a model, the framework will handle the controller, sockets, and api for you.  This isn't to say that you CAN\"T write your own controllers and such, it just makes it easier and faster for you to get a simple API up and running.\r\n\r\nWhen coupled together with front-end frameworks that take advantage of the websockets, Sails.JS can help you build a stunning fast front-end that use a back-end just as fast.\r\n\r\nLets discuss this and see what we think?"

The end goal is removing the need for the `lib` folder, and instead keeping only the necessary pieces of the application in `bower_components`. If you're strapped on time, any advice to help me should I try again would be equally appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n(#552)"

Please let me know and thanks again for your help!\r\n\r\nKevin"
